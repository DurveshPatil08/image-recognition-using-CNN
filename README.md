Project Title: Image Recognition using CNN

This project, developed as part of my intership in artificial intelligence with Acmegrade, showcases my skills in AI, 
machine learning, and data analysis through the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and classify images. 
The notebook leverages Python along with libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to preprocess images, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance on test data. 
To run the project, download the Jupyter Notebook file and install the necessary dependencies. For more information, feel free to connect with
